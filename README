This is a quick README file for the
InfoUAlg project.

This project aims to provide tools to retrieve 
all kinds of information from Algarve’s 
University (UAlg).
It’s a python learning personal project, which 
will help me in the difficult task to learn how to code.

For now, to run this script, these
are the necessary steps:

->download the info_ualg.py and the 
input folder and it's contents
-> run info_ualg
-> at the command line, insert your question to 
the script:

<service> <options> <data>

For now, the only service is "cantina", you
can choose between "almoço" and "jantar" for
the options, and the dates you are free
to use anything (for the moment I only have 
Semptember info). Dates come in the form of
DD-MM-YYYY

This project only accepts the portuguese 
input, and the output is also in portuguese.

Any suggestion please mail me:
